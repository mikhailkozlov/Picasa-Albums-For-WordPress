Picasa Albums For WordPress helps to easily import, display and manage your public Picasa Web Albums right in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Picasa Albums For WordPress gives you full control over how you Picasa Albums displayed in your blog by adding custom post type "Albums" to your WP 3.0. Once Picasa Albums imported, you can rearrange images, hide images and/or change album cover image. Users can add specific album description and control which albums to display on the site. Picasa Albums Settings page allows to set thumbnail size, max image size and cropping options for your images.

If you looking to ease the load on your PHP server by serving static content (images) from CDN or simply short on space on your hosting, Picasa Album is great solutions for you. All images are stored on Google's servers and served to users directly. Picasa Albums does not store any images on your server.

Picasa Albums allows you to import images from any number of Picasa accounts, so you can combine all of your family's pictures in one place. 

Once installed you control:

	* Which albums to show.
	* Album's title, url, description, thumbnail and thumbnail size
	* Which images in the albums to show, images order, thumbnail size and maximum images size
	* If own multiple Picasa accounts, you can import from all of them

Limitations:

    * WordPress 3 and newer
    * PHP 5 with CURL enabled (most web hosters have it)
    * mod_rewrite is required and you must use permalink.

This plugin includes Fancybox and uses it to display enlarged images.
